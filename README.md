# CDNTool
 - CDN Nintendo's servers title downloader (as CIA), with a pretty material UI
 - You can see that in the source code there are some imports called like "Opuka_...", which are not in Python. Those modules contain lots of Python tools, content and libraries, which are the scripts I use to create programs at Opuka, which is my main project. When I publish the first version of Opuka (maybe on Autumn 2018, hoping to finish it before 2019), I'll create some repositories containing different parts of it. For the moment, its source code is private.
 - This program has two windows: the prompt and the UI. All the executions and progresses will be displayed in the prompt (because when a title is downloading the UI freezes, currently fixing it), while you use the UI to select and find the titles.

# How does it look?
